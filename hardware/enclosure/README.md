## Current Status

STL files are under development. Check back for updates or watch the repository for releases.

## Alternative: Commercial Enclosures

If you need an enclosure now, see the [Enclosure & Mounting Guide](../../docs/hardware/05-enclosure-mounting.md) for commercial enclosure recommendations that work with the APIS hardware.

## Contributing

If you've designed a working enclosure for APIS, we welcome contributions. Please ensure designs:

1. Fit the electronics (see BOM in hardware-specification.md)
2. Have camera lens opening
3. Include cable gland mounting holes
4. Achieve IP65 or better with gaskets
5. Include mounting solution (pole or suspended)

Submit via pull request with photos of printed result.
