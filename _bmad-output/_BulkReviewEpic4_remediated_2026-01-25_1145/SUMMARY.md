## Stories Needing Work

All 5 stories in Epic 4 require remediation:

### Story 4-1: Clip Upload Storage (10 issues)
**Critical Issues:**
- [ ] I1: Story status `ready-for-dev` but implementation complete
- [ ] I2: All tasks marked `[ ]` despite being done
- [ ] I3: Empty File List in Dev Agent Record

**High Issues:**
- [ ] I4: API endpoint path mismatch (`/api/units/clips` vs `/api/units/{id}/clips`)
- [ ] I5: Missing integration tests for clip upload handler

### Story 4-2: Clip Archive List View (8 issues)
**Critical Issues:**
- [ ] I1: Story marked "done" but Task 6 (Testing) unchecked and no tests exist

**High Issues:**
- [ ] I2: Empty File List in Dev Agent Record

### Story 4-3: Clip Video Playback (8 issues)
**High Issues:**
- [ ] I2: Task 6 (Testing) marked incomplete - no tests for ClipPlayerModal or GetClipVideo handler

**Medium Issues:**
- [ ] I1: Empty File List in story documentation
- [ ] I6: No video loading state - poor UX on slow connections

### Story 4-4: Clip Management Delete/Archive (7 issues)
**Critical Issues:**
- [ ] I1: Story claims "done" but ALL tasks marked unchecked

**High Issues:**
- [ ] I2: Empty File List documentation
- [ ] I3: AC3 (cleanup function for 30-day old soft-deleted clips) NOT IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] I4: Zero tests for delete functionality

### Story 4-5: Nest Radius Estimator Map (8 issues)
**Medium Issues:**
- [ ] I1: AC1 partially met - uses default marker instead of bee icon
- [ ] I2-I4: No tests for NestEstimatorCard, GetNestEstimate handler, or GetNestEstimateStats

## Common Patterns Across Stories

### 1. Documentation Failures
All 5 stories have empty or incomplete Dev Agent Record File Lists. This breaks traceability and audit trails.

### 2. Test Coverage Gaps
All stories have missing tests:
- No frontend component tests for Clips pages/components
- No backend handler tests for clips endpoints
- Story 4-4 missing cleanup function entirely

### 3. Task Checkbox Mismatches
Stories 4-1, 4-4 have task checkboxes that don't reflect actual implementation state.

## Next Steps

1. **Run `/bulk-remediate 4`** to auto-fix documentation issues (task checkboxes, file lists)
2. **Manual implementation required:**
   - AC3 cleanup function for Story 4-4
   - Bee icon marker for Story 4-5 (if AC is accurate)
3. **Test coverage sprint:**
   - Create clips_test.go for handler tests
   - Create ClipCard.test.tsx, ClipPlayerModal.test.tsx for component tests
   - Create NestEstimatorCard.test.tsx for map component
