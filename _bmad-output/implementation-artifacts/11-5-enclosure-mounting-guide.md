# Story 11.5: Enclosure & Mounting Guide

Status: done

## Story

As a **beekeeper deploying the unit outdoors**,
I want weatherproofing and mounting guidance,
So that my unit survives outdoor conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

All acceptance criteria are covered by the existing comprehensive documentation:

- **AC1: Enclosure Options** - Section 11 with IP rating basics and material choices
- **AC2: Mounting Guide** - Section 9.4 with distance and angle recommendations
- **AC3: Camera Positioning** - Section 10.5 with field of view guidance
- **AC4: Cable Management** - Section 11 with weather-resistant considerations

## Implementation

The enclosure and mounting guidance exists in:
- `docs/hardware-specification.md` Section 11: Enclosure Design
- Covers IP ratings, 3D printing materials (PETG vs ABS vs PLA)
- Includes two-part enclosure design with turret
- Section 9.4: Laser Aiming covers positioning geometry
- Section 10.5: Camera Positioning covers distance and angles

## Dev Agent Record

### Completion Notes

Story already implemented in hardware-specification.md. The documentation includes
enclosure design with ASCII diagrams, material recommendations with trade-offs,
and mounting geometry for optimal hornet detection.
