## Stories Needing Work

### 11-1 Hardware Overview Concepts
- [ ] I1: Power calculation example uses 1550mA vs 1000mA (AC2 specifies 1000mA)
- [ ] I2: Missing explicit GPIO 18 pin selection rationale
- [ ] I3: Missing "what happens if wrong pin" explanation

### 11-2 Pi5 Assembly Manual
- [ ] Missing dedicated `docs/hardware/02-pi5-assembly.md` file (content in consolidated doc)
- [ ] Camera focus verification procedure incomplete
- [ ] Ground loop explanation for servo/laser power needed

### 11-4 XIAO Assembly Manual (Most Critical)
- [ ] **I1:** Missing dedicated assembly file `docs/hardware/04-xiao-assembly.md`
- [ ] **I3:** Missing camera ribbon cable connection guide
- [ ] **I4:** Missing USB flashing guide with step-by-step process
- [ ] BOM cost discrepancy (€22-25 claimed vs €30-45 documented)

### 11-5 Enclosure & Mounting Guide
- [ ] **I1:** Missing IP rating education (what IPX4 means)
- [ ] **I3:** Entire cable management section missing (AC4 unimplemented)
- [ ] Missing commercial enclosure sourcing links
- [ ] Missing suspended mount documentation

### 11-6 Troubleshooting & Safety
- [ ] **I2:** No general debugging workflow for unlisted issues
- [ ] **I5:** Missing software-related troubleshooting guidance

## Stories That Passed

### 11-3 ESP32-CAM Assembly Manual
- **PASS** - All acceptance criteria implemented
- Minor enhancement opportunities: ESP32-specific test examples, Arduino IDE setup

## Next Steps

1. Run `/bulk-remediate` to auto-fix issues across all stories
2. Prioritize Story 11-4 (XIAO) - has 4 HIGH severity issues
3. Address 11-5 (Enclosure) cable management gap - AC4 entirely missing
4. Re-run `/bulk-review 11` after remediation to verify fixes
